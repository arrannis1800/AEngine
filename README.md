# AEngine
## Overview

A small project to understand more clearly how game engines work
This is functional code for game development without a graphic editor

For now, it works on Windows (but it should also work on Linux and MacOS because of GLFW) and uses OpenGL 3 as a graphic API

## Building

You need to have installed OpenGL SDK and recursively clone this repo

After you should execute the following commands

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
